# SQLportfolio
Hello! I used Microsoft SQL Server (2022) for these prjects. I did two projects: an analysis of a company's top employees and a cleanup of the 2018 NYC Central Park Squirrel Census. Clearly, two super-related datasets. I chose these datasets because of their different levels of cleanliness. The HR dataset was well formatted with few NULLs or missing information. I could some basic quality checks, then start querying. On the flip side, the squirrel dataset required significant cleanup. Since this was collected by volunteers (thank you!), I expected it to have some issues. It was pretty "ratty"!
